/**
 * BangAuth — In-Memory User Store Adapter
 *
 * Stores user state (access codes, MFA enrollments) in memory. No persistence —
 * everything resets on container restart. Perfect for dev/demo/constellation MVP.
 *
 * // Why: For a standalone HTTP service with no external database, we need
 * // somewhere to store access codes (email-based auth) and MFA enrollments.
 * // In-memory is fine for MVP — codes expire in 5 minutes, MFA can be re-enrolled.
